# Messenger Platform Sample

This is a sample project showcasing the Messenger Platform for creating bots plus IBM Bluemix service integration for Node.JS Runtime. You can go through the [walk-through](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/quickstart) to understand this code in more detail along with IBM Bluemix Node.JS runtime documents:

All application variables need to be changed for the code to work, like Facebook credentials, Bluemix and NewRelic.
